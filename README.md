# data_mining
building a data mining library from scratch.
Including a tensor computing library suitable for direct product, trace, contraction, exchanging index etc. could handle any shape and dimension, 
another tensor library designed for more practical or advanced purposes such as generalized Kronecker delta, anti-symmetrization and symmetrization, computing determine, invers, eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix.
Also including a imaginary number library in order to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Libraries above are designed for data mining but also cover some fields of scientific computing.
Classic data_mining algorithms are gradually implemented using the libraries.
